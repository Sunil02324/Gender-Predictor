# genderPredictor #
GenderPredictor is a wrapper around [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)'s [Naive Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier for predicting the gender given a name.

Currently it appears to be about 84% accurate on Indian names but this is just the framework.
